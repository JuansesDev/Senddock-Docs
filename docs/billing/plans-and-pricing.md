![Billing Dashboard](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x600/667eea/ffffff?text=Billing+Dashboard)
<!-- TODO: Replace with BillingView screenshot -->

## Pricing Philosophy

SendDock operates with a **BYO-SMTP** (Bring Your Own SMTP) model, which means:

- ✅ **You use your own SMTP provider** (Hostinger, AWS SES, Resend, etc.)
- ✅ **We don't charge by volume** of sending directly
- ✅ **You control your reputation** for IP and deliverability
- ✅ **No vendor lock-in** - your data is yours

Our plans are based on:
- Number of **projects** you can manage
- Number of **subscribers** you can store
- **Monthly sending limit** included in your plan
- Advanced features (Multi-SMTP, Analytics, etc.)

## What Happens When Reaching the Limit?

### Monthly Sending Limit

When you reach 100% of your monthly included limit:

1. **Sends automatically pause**
2. You receive an email notification
3. You have two options:
   - **Wait for the next cycle** (resets on the 1st of each month)
   - **Purchase an additional package** (see next section)

:::tip Early Notifications
SendDock notifies you when you reach 80% and 90% of your monthly limit, so you can plan ahead.
:::

### Subscriber Limit

You can't add more subscribers when you reach your limit. To continue:

- **Upgrade to a higher plan**, or
- **Purchase an additional subscriber package**

### Project Limit

If you reach your project limit, you need to upgrade your plan to create more.

## Additional Packages (Lifetime)

This is SendDock's unique feature: **Packages that never expire**.

### How Do They Work?

Imagine you have the **Starter Plan ($15/mo)** which includes 40,000 sends/month.

In November, you run a large campaign and:
- Use your 40,000 included sends
- But need to send 60,000 more emails

**Solution:** Buy a package of **+20,000 sends** for $10 (example)

#### Month 1 (November):
```
Included sends:     40,000
Purchased package:  +20,000
------------------------
Total available:     60,000
Used:               60,000
Remaining:               0
```

#### Month 2 (December):
```
Included sends:     40,000 (your monthly plan renewed)
November package:        0 (you consumed it all)
------------------------
Total available:     40,000
```

But if in November you had only used 50,000:

#### Month 2 (December):
```
Included sends:     40,000 (your monthly plan renewed)
November package:   +10,000 (leftover from last month)
------------------------
Total available:     50,000
```

:::info Packages That Don't Expire
Additional packages **never expire**. They are consumed month by month until depleted. If you buy 100,000 extra sends and only use 1,000 this month, the remaining 99,000 stays available forever.
:::

### Available Packages

#### Send Packages

| Package | Price | Cost per Email |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| +10,000 sends | $8 | $0.0008 |
| +20,000 sends | $15 | $0.00075 |
| +50,000 sends | $35 | $0.0007 |
| +100,000 sends | $65 | $0.00065 |
| +500,000 sends | $300 | $0.0006 |

#### Subscriber Packages

| Package | Price |
|---------|--------|
| +1,000 subscribers | $10 |
| +5,000 subscribers | $40 |
| +10,000 subscribers | $75 |
| +25,000 subscribers | $175 |

![Add-on Packages](https://via.placeholder.com/1000x600/f6ad55/ffffff?text=Add-on+Packages)
<!-- TODO: Replace with packages section screenshot -->

### When to Buy Packages

**Buying packages makes sense when:**

✅ You have a large one-time campaign (product launch, Black Friday)
✅ Your usage varies month by month
✅ You don't want to permanently upgrade to a higher plan
✅ You prefer to pay only for what you use

**Upgrading your plan makes sense when:**

✅ You consistently reach your monthly limit
✅ You need advanced features (Multi-SMTP, Analytics)
✅ You prefer to predict your exact monthly spending

## Billing and Cycles

### Monthly Cycle

- Billed each month on your subscription date
- Example: You subscribe on January 15 → next invoice February 15
- Sending limits reset each cycle

### Annual Cycle

- Billed once a year
- **16% discount** (equivalent to 2 months free)
- Sending limits still reset monthly
- Can't change to monthly until the year expires

:::tip Recommendation
If you know you'll use SendDock for more than 6 months, the annual plan always comes out cheaper.
:::

## Plan Changes

### Upgrade (Increase Plan)

You can upgrade your plan at any time:

1. Go to **Dashboard → Billing**
2. Click **"Upgrade Plan"**
3. Select the new plan
4. The difference is prorated for the remaining period

**Example:**
- You're on Starter ($15/mo)
- On day 15 you upgrade to Pro ($49/mo)
- You already paid $15 for the full month
- You're charged: ($49 - $15) × (15 days remaining / 30 days) = $17
- Total charged today: $17
- Next full $49 invoice will be next month

![Upgrade Flow](https://via.placeholder.com/800x500/20c997/ffffff?text=Upgrade+Plan+Flow)
<!-- TODO: Replace with upgrade flow screenshot -->

### Downgrade (Reduce Plan)

You can reduce your plan, but with considerations:

1. The change applies **at the end of the current period**
2. No refund for remaining time
3. You must be within the limits of the new plan
   - Example: Can't downgrade to Starter (3 projects) if you have 5 active projects

**Steps:**
1. Go to **Dashboard → Billing**
2. Click **"Change Plan"**
3. Select the lower plan
4. Confirm (will apply when renewing)

:::warning Check Limits
Before downgrading, make sure you're within the new plan's limits. SendDock will alert you if you don't meet the conditions.
